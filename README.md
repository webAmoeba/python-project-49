# Brain Games

Welcome to the Brain Games project! This repository contains a collection of fun and challenging games designed to test your mathematical and logical skills. 

## Features

- Answer "yes" if the number is even, otherwise answer "no".
- Calculate the result of a given mathematical expression.
- Find the greatest common divisor (GCD) of provided numbers.
- Identify the missing number in a progression.
- Answer "yes" if a given number is prime, otherwise answer "no".
